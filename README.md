# What is JS?
## JavaScript is a popular programming 
language that has a wide range of 
applications.
JavaScript was previously used mainly for 
making webpages interactive such as form

JavaScript is also used in many other areas

# JavaScript Variables and Constants
## In Javascript there is two types of intializing variables, var and let. You can use both of them.
However, there are some differences between them.
In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.
If you are sure that the value of a variable won't change throughout the program, it's recommended
to use const .
